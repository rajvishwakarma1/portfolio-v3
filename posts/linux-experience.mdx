title: "why i switched from windows to linux (and back)"

every developer has that phase where they think "real programmers use linux." i had that phase. it lasted about three months.

## the trigger

it started when i saw someone's [i3wm rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) on reddit. beautiful tiled windows, minimal design, everything controlled by keyboard. my windows desktop with its bloated taskbar suddenly felt embarrassing.

that weekend, i downloaded [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and dual-booted.

## day 1: excitement

everything felt fresh. the terminal wasn't just for running node commands, it was the entire experience. i spent hours customizing my bash prompt:

```bash
# my first attempt at a custom prompt
PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '

# then i discovered oh-my-zsh and felt foolish
```

installing things through apt felt powerful:

```bash
sudo apt install vim git nodejs
```

no more downloading .exe files and clicking through installers. this was how coding was meant to be.

> the first week on linux makes you feel like a hacker. then reality hits.

## week 2: the struggles begin

**wifi drivers didn't work out of the box.** three hours of googling and terminal commands later, i had wifi. but i still don't really understand what i did.

**my trackpad was weird.** gestures that worked on windows? gone. had to install some third-party tool that half-worked.

**microsoft office:** my college required .docx submissions. libreoffice was "compatible" but formatting always broke. ended up dual-booting just for assignments.

**everything required troubleshooting:**

```bash
# me every time something didn't work
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
# still broken
*googles error message*
# finds forum post from 2014
# tries random command
# somehow works
```

## month 2: the terminal love affair

despite the pain, something clicked. i started living in the terminal.

file management:
```bash
cd ~/projects
mkdir new-project && cd $_
touch index.js
```

git workflow:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "fix: that bug" && git push
```

finding files:
```bash
find . -name "*.js" | xargs grep "TODO"
```

the speed of keyboard-driven workflows was addictive. no more clicking through folders.

## the breaking point

around month 3, i had an important assignment due. i was making final edits, and something crashed. i don't even remember what. but i spent 2 hours fixing the system instead of finishing my work.

that's when i realized: linux was fun, but it was costing me time i didn't have.

## the middle ground

here's where i ended up:

**for windows:**
- [wsl2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (windows subsystem for linux)
- [windows terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) with a pretty theme
- [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing

**the result:** linux terminal experience with windows stability.

```powershell
# accessing linux from windows
wsl -d Ubuntu

# now i'm in bash
cd ~/projects
npm run dev
```

best of both worlds. i get the terminal workflow i love, but when i need to submit a word doc or use some windows-only software, i'm not fighting my system.

## what linux taught me

even though i "went back," linux taught me:

1. **the terminal is powerful** — every developer should be comfortable with bash
2. **customization is a rabbit hole** — fun but time-consuming
3. **understanding your system matters** — i actually learned what PATH is
4. **pick the right tool for the job** — sometimes that's linux, sometimes it's not
5. **wsl is genuinely good** — microsoft did something right

## my current setup

i'm now on windows with wsl2 as my development environment. docker runs in wsl. node runs in wsl. but i edit in windows vs code (with the wsl extension).

it's not "pure" and linux enthusiasts might judge me. but it works. it lets me focus on coding instead of fighting drivers.

that said, i still have a soft spot for linux. maybe one day i'll have a dedicated linux machine for proper development. but for now, wsl is my happy medium.

also, i still don't really understand what `sudo chmod 777` does. i just know it fixes permission errors.
