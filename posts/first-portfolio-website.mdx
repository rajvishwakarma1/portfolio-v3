every developer has that moment when they decide "i need a portfolio website." for me, that moment came during third semester when everyone started talking about internships and having an "online presence."

## the naive beginning

i had grand visions. animated backgrounds, 3d elements, those fancy scroll effects i saw on awwwards. i was going to build the most impressive student portfolio ever.

reality hit fast.

```css
/* my first attempt at centering a div */
.container {
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    text-align: center;
    /* none of this worked */
}
```

three hours later, i discovered [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). another two hours to understand it.

```css
/* the revelation */
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

why didn't anyone tell me this earlier?

## scope creep is real

my initial plan was simple: a landing page with my info and links. what i ended up trying to build:

- animated particle background (because it looked cool)
- custom cursor effects (why?)
- typing animation for my name
- dark/light mode toggle
- project showcase with hover effects
- blog section (that i'd never update)
- contact form with email integration

spoiler: i finished maybe 30% of this.

## the css nightmare

css and i had a toxic relationship during this project. things that should have been simple took hours:

**making the layout responsive:**

```css
/* me thinking i understood media queries */
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .nav {
        display: none; /* just hide it lol */
    }
}
```

**getting fonts to work:**

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'CoolFont';
    src: url('./fonts/font.woff2');
    /* why isn't this loading?? */
}
```

**that one element that refused to align:**

every. single. time.

> i probably learned more css from stackoverflow answers than any tutorial.

## the deployment saga

after two weeks of on-and-off work, i had something that didn't look terrible. time to put it online.

options i tried:

1. **[github pages](https://pages.github.com/)** — worked after figuring out the branch settings
2. **[netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** — drag and drop was magical
3. **[vercel](https://vercel.com/)** — felt like overkill for a static site

i went with github pages because it felt more "developer-y." the satisfaction of seeing my name followed by `.github.io` was real.

## what i actually learned

looking back, that first portfolio taught me more than any tutorial:

- **css is hard, but it clicks eventually** — flexbox and grid solved 90% of my problems
- **done is better than perfect** — shipped it with missing features, still felt good
- **nobody notices the small stuff** — i spent hours on a hover animation that nobody ever mentioned
- **simple is underrated** — the cleanest portfolios i've seen are the simplest ones

## the iterations

that first portfolio? i rebuilt it. twice. then three more times. each iteration was simpler and better.

version 1: overcomplicated mess with particles
version 2: still too much animation
version 3: cleaner, but slow
version 4: minimal, fast, actually readable

## advice for your first portfolio

if you're building your first portfolio:

1. **start simple** — you can always add features later
2. **steal designs** — look at portfolios you like, understand what works
3. **focus on content** — your projects matter more than fancy animations
4. **just deploy it** — a live simple site beats a perfect local one
5. **iterate** — your first version will be bad, and that's okay

that first portfolio is probably still archived somewhere on my github. i cringe looking at the code, but i'm grateful for the lessons it taught me.

also, i still don't fully understand css grid. but we're working on it.
