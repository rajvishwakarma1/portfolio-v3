i've been there. staring at a screen at 2am, eyes burning, brain foggy, wondering why something that used to excite me now feels like a chore. burnout is real, and it doesn't discriminate, it hits beginners and senior devs alike.

## the ugly truth about hustle culture

we all know how thrilling it is to build something amazing and see our code come to life. but let's be honest, the actual coding is only 20% of the work. the rest is motivation, discipline, and sheer willpower to keep going.

as students or early-career devs, we often find ourselves juggling a gazillion things at once. deadlines, projects, exams, side hustles. it's enough to make anyone's head spin.

> it's totally okay to admit that sometimes, it's just too much.

coding hackathons, all-nighters, and endless coding sessions may feel heroic. but they come at a cost. burnout sneaks up on us, and suddenly, our passion for coding feels like it's fading away.

## recognizing the signs

here's what burnout looked like for me:

- dreading opening my code editor
- feeling exhausted even after a full night's sleep
- getting frustrated at small bugs that i'd normally solve easily
- losing interest in side projects i used to be excited about
- constantly feeling behind, no matter how much i worked

if any of these sound familiar, you're not alone.

## finding balance

the good news is that life is all about finding balance. here's what actually helped me:

### manage your time differently

yeah, easier said than done. but it's worth a shot. create a schedule that allows for some breathing room. breaks are not the enemy, they're our secret weapon against burnout.

i started using the pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break) and it made a huge difference. sounds simple, but forcing yourself to step away helps.

### set realistic goals

let's cut ourselves some slack when it comes to goals. sure, aiming high is great, but setting realistic targets is the key to staying consistent.

breaking big tasks into smaller, manageable chunks is the best way to actually achieve anything. i stopped trying to "build the whole feature today" and started with "just write the api endpoint first."

### you're not alone in this

every developer, irrespective of their experience level, has felt burnout at some point. sharing struggles can be therapeutic. it reminds us that we're not the only ones riding this roller coaster.

> talking to other devs about burnout was one of the most helpful things i did. turns out, everyone's fighting the same battles.

## building a support system

diving into coding communities helped me a lot. hackathons (just for fun, not to win), discord servers, twitter/x dev communities, online forums. surrounding ourselves with like-minded folks can reignite our passion for coding and boost our spirits when things get tough.

find your people. whether that's a study group, a discord server, or just one friend who gets it.

## final thoughts

embrace those breaks. lean on each other for support. remember that your mental well-being matters just as much as your coding skills.

your worth as a developer isn't measured by how many hours you can grind. it's measured by what you build, the problems you solve, and the impact you have, all of which require a healthy mind.

we're in this together. take care of yourself.
