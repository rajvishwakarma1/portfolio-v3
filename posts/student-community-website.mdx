during my second year, a few friends and i decided to build a website for students in our college. a place to share notes, connect with seniors, find resources. simple idea. turned out to be way more than a coding project.

## the idea

it started in a group chat. someone complained about not finding notes for a subject. another person mentioned a senior who had great resources but no way to share them. and then someone said the magic words:

"we should build something for this."

two weeks later, we were actually doing it.

## the team

we had four people:
- me (frontend + "full stack when needed")
- one guy who knew backend (kind of)
- one guy who knew design (sort of)
- one guy who was "learning but enthusiastic"

classic college team. nobody was an expert, but we were going to figure it out.

## the tech decisions

first meeting was about tech stack. spent two hours debating:

```
me: let's use react
backend guy: but i only know node with ejs
designer: can't we just use wordpress?
learner: what's a tech stack?
```

we ended up with:
- html/css/js for frontend (simple wins)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [express](https://expressjs.com/) for backend
- [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database (because it's easy to set up)
- [github](https://github.com/) for collaboration

looking back, we overcomplicated some things and undercomplicated others. but we shipped.

## the actual building

### version 1: the mess

first working version took a month. it was ugly. the css was inconsistent. the code had no structure. but it worked.

```html
<!-- actual code from v1 -->
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; color: blue;">
            <!-- inline styles everywhere -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

we were so proud.

### version 2: slightly less mess

after showing it to some friends, we got feedback:
- "it's hard to navigate"
- "why doesn't login work sometimes?"
- "can you add dark mode?"

we fixed some things. broke others. shipped anyway.

> building for real users is different from building for yourself. feedback hits different.

## the non-code challenges

the technical stuff was actually the easiest part. the hard parts:

**coordination:** four people with different schedules. one guy would work at 2am, another only had time on weekends. syncing was chaos.

**scope creep:** every week someone had a new feature idea. "what if we add chat?" "what about a marketplace?" we had to learn to say no.

**motivation dips:** after the initial excitement, there were weeks where nobody touched the code. real life got in the way.

**the "it's on my system" problem:**
```
// works on my machine
// breaks on yours
// neither of us knows why
```

**user adoption:** building something is one thing. getting people to use it is another. we had to actually promote it, make posters, convince people it was useful.

## what i learned

this project taught me more than any course:

1. **communication > code** — most problems were coordination issues, not technical ones
2. **start small, ship fast** — our mvp was embarrassingly simple, but it was alive
3. **real users = real feedback** — you don't know what's wrong until someone complains
4. **git is essential** — we had so many merge conflicts, but at least we had git
5. **finishing is harder than starting** — the last 20% takes 80% of the time

## the outcome

the website ran for about a year. a few hundred students used it. it wasn't a startup success story. but it was something real that we built.

more importantly:
- i learned how to work in a team
- i understood the gap between "a feature" and "a finished product"
- i had something real to show in interviews
- i made friends through the project

## the code still exists

the repository is still on my github. sometimes i look at the code and cringe. but i also remember the late-night debugging sessions, the excitement when features worked, the pizza celebrations after deployments.

that messy codebase represents growth. and that's worth more than clean architecture.

if you're thinking about building something with friends, do it. the project might fail, but the experience won't.
